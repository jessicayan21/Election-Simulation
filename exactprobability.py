The probabilities contained in the 2000.pdf file had been determined by extensive polling for Gore winning each of the 17 states (denote by p1,...,p17). Instead of p=0.5, each of the 17 Battleground States is determined by it own Bernoulli random variable - ie. Wisconsin has p=0.946 while Nevada has p=0.146. Using these new probabilities and the Monte Carlo method (using 1 million copies to average), this code simulates to obtain the probability that Bush would win the election, and the probability that Gore would win the election, and the probability of a tie
